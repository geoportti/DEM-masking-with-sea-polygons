# Masking water areas in digital elevation models

Digital elevation models (dem) can contain a lot of errors at water areas. The sea areas of Finnish 2m dem for example, can contain several meters of value differences on both sides of 0. This is why it is usually good practice to mask sea areas to value 0 before running any further analyses on them. In the image 1 you can see clearly dem value differences at the sea areas.
